# Shopping Cart  

**The Odin Project - React Course**  

A React-based shopping cart application that fetches products from an external API, featuring a homepage, a shop page with individual product cards, and a cart system that allows users to add, remove, and update item quantities. The app uses React Router for navigation, includes a live cart counter, and is tested using React Testing Library.
